# We Need to Talk About Social Media

Social media is a unique technological beast. While social media lets
us engage in discussions, explore and share our interests, and connect
with friends, families, and others, it isn't without its faults. In
recent years, social media has an ever-growing problem with
disinformation and hate speech, the design of the software is geared
towards engagement at any cost, and  many are plagued with various
privacy and security issues. Tangentially, I've been noticing on the
GopherApp a growing need to design a system for discussions in a
social-like format. Many want to discuss complex topics but are unable
to set up conferences or handle it through email. Social media _may_
be able to solve this problem, but the solution may be very nuanced and
complex.

## Objective

For this project, I propose to do the following:

- Devise an experiment that explores what parts of social media are
  conducive to discussion and how we can redesign social media apps;
- Develop a cross-platform app that builds off of the ideas present
  in the experiment;
- Deploy the app as a private beta to Goucher students and collect
  voluntary data for analysis;
- Analyze the data and come up with a conclusion to the experiment,
  which may or may not result in an app release.

## Timeline

I will divide the project into the following simple timeline:

- **Week 1**: Devising the experiment that I will build upon for the
  rest of the project
- **Weeks 2-4**: Designing a prototype app that meets the criteria of
  the experiment
- **Weeks 5-8**: Expanding on the prototype to a near-complete app
  that can be deployed
- **Weeks 9-11**: Deploying the app as a private beta for Goucher
  students and collecting survey data
- **Week 12**: Analyzing the results of the data and writing a
  conclusion to the experiment
- **Weeks 13-14**: Creating the final presentation materials that
  present my findings, as well as deciding whether to publish the app

This timeline is _tentative_ and is by no means a formal structure.
Depending on the speed and progress I'm currently at, the timeline
may fluctuate a little.

## Standup Meetings

I also propose that at the end of every week (or two weeks), I meet
with my advisor/project mentor to perform a standup on the project as
well as asking any questions or bringing forth project concerns. This
will help ensure the following:

- I am managing my time efficiently and am working on the project
  actively.
- I address any problems quickly and without delay.
- I can reassess the state of the project and adjust the timeline
  accordingly.

## Development and Resources

For this capstone, I will utilize the tools available to Apple
platforms. Although Apple's relationship with third-party developers
is currently on ice given the Epic v. Apple trial and rising
antitrust concerns, they offer nearly everything necessary to write
and deploy an app for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. They
also offer TestFlight, which will be helpful in running the app as a
private beta; TestFlight is also arriving on the Mac alongside macOS
Monterey (v12) via Xcode, which will help streamline deployment.

Regarding the backend materials needed for this project, I propose
utilizing the already existing Gopherdon social network. Gopherdon,
being an instance of Mastodon, provides a fantastic API that lets
third-party developers write clients for the network (and any
Mastodon-capable platform) easily. Since Gopherdon is in public beta
and available to Goucher students, all that students would need are a
Gopherdon account, and no extra tooling is required to make this work.

I will also be using the Git version control system as I typically
have to sync, share, and back up my work. Ideally, I'd like to have
this repository shared with my advisor so they can view the source
code at any time. My origin remote of choice is GitHub, which also
offers support for reporting issues, displaying project kanban boards,
and continuous integration.

the problem proposed and may offer solutions.
