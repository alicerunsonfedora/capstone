## Primary Objectives

This project aims to experiment with the following:

- Making social media less addictive and more conducive to discussion.
- Creating a _humane_ design by allowing more humane interactions, being
  inclusive, and being accountable in source.
- Being _frugally_ designed by being lightweight, network-efficient, and
  native with SwiftUI and other iOS/macOS technologies.
  
More information on the objectives of this project can be discovered in
the OBJECTIVES.md file, located in the root of the project's source code.
