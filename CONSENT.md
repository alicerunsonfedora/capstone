# TestFlight Beta Program Consent Form

Thank you, the user, for taking the time to sign up for the TestFlight
program for Codename “Shout” (herein referenced as “the software” or
“software solution”). Review the following important information carefully
before proceeding to join the TestFlight program for the software as
indicated.

## Contact
For any questions or concerns you might have about the TestFlight program
and/or research project, please contact the following members with the
contact information provided:

- Researcher (Marquis Kurt): marquis.kurt@goucher.edu
- Advisor (Jill Zimmerman): jill.zimmerman@goucher.edu

## TestFlight Objectives
Social media is a unique technological beast. While social media lets us
engage in discussions, explore and share our interests, and connect with
friends, families, and others, it isn’t without its faults. In recent
years, social media has an ever-growing problem with disinformation and
hate speech, the design of the software is geared towards engagement at
any cost, and many are plagued with various privacy and security issues.
Tangentially, a growing need to design a system for discussions in a
social-like format exists on the GopherApp. Many want to discuss complex
topics but are unable to set up conferences or handle it through email.
Social media may be able to solve this problem, but the solution may be
very nuanced and complex.

This beta program will test a software solution to the proposed problem,
which is designed to be focused around discussions. 

## Methods and Distribution
The software will be distributed through Apple’s TestFlight program. More
information on how the TestFlight process works can be found on Apple’s
website at https://testflight.apple.com. _It is strongly encouraged that
you read this information, along with the information provided in this
consent form, to fully understand how TestFlight will be used to beta test
the software_.

## Data Collection Policy
Over the course of the TestFlight program, you will be able to submit
feedback to improve the software through two means: the tools available in
TestFlight, and the YouTrack bug reporting service. The following data
will be collected when you submit feedback:

TestFlight (either a crash report or a screenshot):
- Device Type, Time Zone, and Software Version
- Battery Level, Internet Connection Type, Screen Resolution, Disk Space
- Other data outlined at https://testflight.apple.com/#privacy-data

YouTrack:
- Device Type and Software Version

Note that none of the data provided by TestFlight and/or YouTrack can be
linked back to you. YouTrack reports are filed under a guest account with
no personally-identifying information. _Never include any personal
information or uniquely identifying information that can be traced back to
you in your feedback_.

### Security Vulnerabilities
Reports of potential security vulnerability issues such as privilege
escalation or remote code execution should be sent via email to the
addresses listed in the Contact section of this form, and _never_ via
YouTrack or TestFlight. This information will be treated as confidential
and will only be referenced by/visible to the research team. When the 
security vulnerability has been addressed in a new TestFlight build, all
copies of the security vulnerability report will be deleted.

### Internal Testing Ring
If you opt-in to the internal testing ring which receives updates more
frequently, your email address will be collected to send you the
appropriate TestFlight invitation. This information will be discarded once
the TestFlight invitation has been sent to the appropriate email address.

### Usage of Gopherdon
The software uses Gopherdon, a Goucher service powered by Mastodon, as its
backend. Users of the software are bound to the terms and conditions of
the Gopherdon service, located at https://mastodon.goucher.edu/terms.

## Risk
There is minimal risk involved when beta testing this software that should
not interfere with daily life tasks. However, it is important to note that
the software is in a pre-release state; as such, features and designs are
not final and will change over time. By consenting to participate and
participating in the TestFlight program, you acknowledge the risks
associated with testing beta software, including (but not limited to) the
following:
- Lack of polish in the software
- Freezes or crashes from using the software

## Right to Withdraw
You have the right to withdraw from the TestFlight program at any time by
uninstalling the app from your device and tapping “Stop Testing” in the
TestFlight app. More information on how to opt-out of testing can be found
on Apple’s website at https://testflight.apple.com.
